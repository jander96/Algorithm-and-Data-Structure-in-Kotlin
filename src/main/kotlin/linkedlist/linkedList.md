A linked list is a collection of values arranged in a linear, unidirectional sequence. A
linked list has several theoretical advantages over contiguous storage options such
as the Kotlin Array or ArrayList:
- Constant time insertion and removal from the front of the list.
-  Reliable performance characteristics.

As the diagram suggests, a linked list is a chain of nodes. Nodes have two
responsibilities:
1. Hold a value.
2. Hold a reference to the next node. The absence of a reference to the next node,
null, marks the end of the list.
